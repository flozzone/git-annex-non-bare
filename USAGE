Checkout and work with the repository

- clone and initialize the repository

  # git clone git@localhost:my-repo.git
  # cd my-repo

# initialize git-annex with a name for this clone

  # git annex init "my-username"

- work with it: Add binary files

  # cp /media/sound/sound.mp3 .
  # git annex add sound.mp3

- work with it: Add other stuff

  # echo test > test

- commit your changes

  # git add test
  # git commit -m test

  # NOTICE: Don't use push to push your changes to the server. Use "git annex sync" instead, it will do
  # the rest for you.

- copy added data to the origin server

  # git annex copy --to origin

- push your repository changes to origin  (data is not copied). If you run this before copying
data on the server, it will return an error and reject the push. If everthing is ok this command will update
the remote working directory.

  # git annex sync

- drop uploaded files from local machine (data gets deleted from local machine but is still on the server)

  # git annex drop .
